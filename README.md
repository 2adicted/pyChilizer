# pyChilizer


This is an extension for pyRevit. pyRevit (with lowercase *py*) is a Rapid Application Prototyping (RAD) environment for Autodesk RevitÂ®.

Besides the many useful tools that come with 'vanilla' pyRevit, the platform that pyRevit provides is invaluable for rapid Revit API tools prototyping and makes deployment a breeze. 

pyChilizer is an extension done by Archilizer that contains many bite-size applications for Revit that aim to automate the drudgery of everyday draughting. It is also a repository/dump for all cool ideas that can later be developed into stand-alone Revit Add-ins. This project is open-source and free to use.
